### Bio
I am currently working at [Takram](https://www.takram.com)'s London studio as a lead creative technologist.

My primary interests are centred around emerging technologies. I probe future visions that they promise, reveal the cultural and political mechanisms behind them, and illustrate insights through making various prototypes. By doing so, I aim to facilitate in-depth understanding of the implication of emerging technologies, and encourage better-informed decision-making on our future.

牛込陽介。[Takram](https://www.takram.com)リードクリエイティブテクノロジスト。

先端技術のもつ意味や可能性に対する理解を助け、未来に関するより確かな意思決定を促すことを目的に、リサーチやコンセプト構築、プロトタイプを通してのコンセプトの表現、インタラクションデザインなどに取り組んでいる。
